# Audio Journal (Mac Desktop)

A **local-first, AI-powered audio journaling app** for Mac and cross-platform desktop. Your audio, transcripts, and summaries stay on your deviceâ€”never in the cloud.

---

## Why Audio Journal?

Most audio journaling apps send your private thoughts to the cloud for AI processing. **Audio Journal is different:**
- **Local-first:** All audio, transcription, and summaries are processed and stored on your computer. Nothing leaves your device.
- **Obsidian Integration:** Export entries as Markdown to your Obsidian vault, complete with tags, transcripts, and AI-generated summaries.
- **Own your data:** No accounts, no subscriptions, no vendor lock-in.

---

## Features
- **Record audio journal entries** directly from the app.
- **Import existing audio files** (with smart entry naming).
- **Automatic transcription** using OpenAI Whisper (runs locally).
- **AI-powered summaries** using your choice of local LLM (e.g., GPT4All, llama.cpp).
- **Browse and search** all your entries, transcripts, and summaries.
- **Export to Obsidian** (or any Markdown-based system) with one click.
- **Tag entries** for easy organization.

## Installation

### Requirements
- **macOS, Windows, or Linux**

## Platform Notes

- **macOS:** Fully supported, tested on Apple Silicon and Intel Macs.
- **Windows/Linux:** Supported, but you must have Python 3.11+ and dependencies installed system-wide. Some features (like microphone permissions) may require additional setup.
- **Python:** You must use a system Python install, not a virtual environment, so the Electron app can invoke it.
